# Visualizer

This project is a 3D visualization tool designed to read, translate, and display 3D object files in various formats, including OBJ and STL. It includes a set of data readers and writers for managing geometric shapes, and it renders 3D objects in a visual format.

## Features

- **3D Object Support**: Reads and writes OBJ and STL files.
- **Geometry Processing**: Handles points, triangles, and triangulations for constructing 3D shapes.
- **Data Translation**: Translates data into visual representations for easy inspection.
- **Modular Design**: Separate headers and source files for each component.

## Project Structure

- **headers/**: Contains header files defining core classes and data structures.
- **src/**: Implementation of the classes and functions for reading, writing, and visualizing 3D objects.
- **main.cpp**: The entry point of the program, managing the visualization process.
- **Visualizer_output.JPG**: A sample output image demonstrating the visualization capability.
